# Quest 2
1. Pillars of Cadence Programming language
-Safety & security
-Clarity
-Approachability
-Developer experience
-Resource Oriented Programming

2. Cadence is simplifying Smart Contracts for both the developer & user. It was created because cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH are operating far beyond the scope of what is cost effective or necessary for most DApps & NFT transactions. Eliminating the clutter of unnecessary data cuts the cost of validation as well as being more environmentally friendly by requiring much less processing power to do so.

3. Jacob is a super genius.

# Quest 1
1. A Blockchain is a decentralized database that stores  information. It is mainly used to store transactions in a secure, transparent way.
This data is stored in "blocks" which each hold a certain amount and once full are closed and chained to other closed blocks of data forming what we refer to as the Blockchain.
2. A Smart Contract is a set of rules governing how specific transactions are to be executed within the Blockchain.
It elimates the need for a third party to be involved because the transaction is viewable and verifiable to both parties involved in the transaction.
Blockchain data is encrypted and chained to previously executed data making it nearly impossible to hack.
3.  A transaction is a function call that alters data on the Blockchain.
A script allows you to view the data.

Bonus points.
Jacob is the best.
